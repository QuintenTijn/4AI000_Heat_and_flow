Assignment:

We make different machine learning models to predict the output translational_velocity and angular_velocity after the gas particles off of the wall.
We test the performance of the models on the data we have and report on the results and which model ends up being the best for the task.

we will iteratively build each model by having it perform the following model tasks:
    A. The first iteration of the model will predict the reflection without any interaction between particles
    B. The second iteration of the model will predict the reflection with a Couette flow present.
    C. The third iteration of the model will predict the distribution of translational and angular velocities and predict the accommodation coefficients.
    D. Compare GMM and Bayesian model/DNN on ACC predictions.


Done milestones:
    Milestones for part A:
        1. Specify correct paths to the data in the code to be able to run the data preprocessing
        2. Implement simple GMM to perform task 1.
        3. Train GMM using given training data.

Next milestones:
    Milestones for part B:
        4. Put 10D data through data preprocessing
        5. Implement GMM to perform task B.
        6. Plot the results of task B.
