Assignment:

We make a gaussian mixture model to compute the output translational_velocity, angular_velocity after reflecting off of the wall.

Tasks:
A. The first model will predict the reflection without any interaction between particles
B. The second model will predict the reflection with a Couette flow present.
C. The third model will predict the distribution of translational and angular velocities and predict the accommodation coefficients.
D. Compare GMM and Bayesian model/DNN on ACC predictions.

 
As inputs we have the v_t and v_omega from he liao_transfer_function


Questions:

- What is the v_mp (most probable velocity)?
- How do we evaluate the performance of our model? Especially for part 3. where we have to predict the accommodation coefficients.
- For task 4 do you already have a Bayesian model to compare our predictions against?
- For assignment A, do we use the data of all the 3 files alltogether, or do we train 3 seperate models for each file? since the parameters are different for each text file I would assume the latter?
- Why are we using Gaussian Mixture Modeling to model the reflection behaviour? wouldn't a regression model be better at figuring out the relation (reflection) between input and output?

Steps for part A:
1. Specify correct paths to the data in the code to be able to run the data preprocessing
2. Implement simple GMM to perform task 1.
3. Train GMM using given training data.
