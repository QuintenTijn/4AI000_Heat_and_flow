Problem statemtent:
What machine learning model has the best performance in terms of speed and accuracy in predicting the reflection and accomodation coefficients of Hydrogen gas particles off of a interface?

We make different machine learning models to predict the output translational_velocity and angular_velocity after the gas particles off of the wall.
We test the performance of the models on the data we have and report on the results and which model ends up being the best for the task.

we will iteratively build each model by having it perform the following model tasks:
    A. The first iteration of the model will predict the reflection without any interaction between particles
    B. The second iteration of the model will predict the reflection with a Couette flow present.
    C. The third iteration of the model will predict the distribution of translational and angular velocities and predict the accommodation coefficients.
    D. Compare GMM and Bayesian model/DNN on ACC predictions.
