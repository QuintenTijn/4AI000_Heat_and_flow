Minutes_meeting_2025-05-08
*Present: Silvia, Tijn, Thomas Roza, Joris Schekkerman*
*Minute taker: Tijn* 
*Purpose of meeting: Discuss the research each of the two groups will focus on.*

Silvia proposes she hands us and the Mechanical Engineering (ME) group the Gaussian mixture model they developed for the reflection problem.

During the first week we can then use the GMM to explore the data, see how stratifyig the data effects it.

The ME group wants to try and build a Bayesian model that predicts the outgoing velocities for a single particle dependent on its incoming velocity.

Silvia proposes making a classiefier model that classifies a particle based on its incoming parameters to decide in which regime it will reflect and then based on that class we can commpute predicted outgoing parameters.
We then also have to calculate the alphas (accommodation coefficients) for each of the reflection regimes, it is currently unkown how many regimes there are.

it feels like if we make a Bayesian model and/or a regression model to predict the reflection of a single particle or at least its reflection probabilities Silvia will be very happy.


Final decision on the projects:
- Jesper and Tijn try different models on the data to compute the reflection based on the data. Think Bayesian model, regression model, different Gaussian Mixture model and a classification model to predict reflection regimes.
- ME group makes a single model and computes the alpha, looks into the physics of why the different reflection modes occur.

Midterm presentation:
