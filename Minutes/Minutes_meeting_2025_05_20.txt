Meeting 20-05-2025

1. I did not have progress meeting with tijn, so I was unable to give an update on that
    (ik had geen tijd meer om de git te bereiken)

2. I initialized a bayesian model and compared it with the gaussian model from the paper. However, I want the code from the paper because I do not get the same gaussian as in the paper
(it uses 600 components, but mine doesnt converge then)
    ->  I asked sylvia to send me the code of this paper

Once this has been done, we can start comparing the models for couette flows with high velocity and actually see some results

AP Jesper: Studentennummers van Tijn + Jesper doorsturen naar Silvia
