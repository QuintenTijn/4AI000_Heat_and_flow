Assignment:

We make a gaussian mixture model to compute the output translational_velocity, angular_velocity after reflecting off of the wall.

Tasks:
1. The first model will predict the reflection without any interaction between particles
2. The second model will predict the reflection with a Couette flow present.
3. The third model will predict the distribution of translational and angular velocities and predict the accommodation coefficients.
4. Compare GMM and Bayesian model/DNN on ACC predictions.

 
As inputs we have the v_t and v_omega from he liao_transfer_function


Questions:

- What is the v_mp (most probable velocity)?
- How do we evaluate the performance of our model? Especially for part 3. where we have to predict the accommodation coefficients.
- For task 4 do you already have a Bayesian model to compare our predictions against?


Steps:
1. Specify correct paths to the data in the code to be able to run the data preprocessing
2. Implement simple GMM to perform task 1.
3. Train GMM.
